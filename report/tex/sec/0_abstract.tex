 In this study, we analyzed 13,251 football transfer rumors collected from \url{www.transfermarkt.co.uk}. We clustered the news sources using metrics such as coverage, accuracy, and a new “EarlyBird” metric that measures how much earlier a transfer is reported before it happens. This allowed us to identify common strategies used by these sources. Additionally, we extracted key features from the rumors and developed a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a reported transfer occurring. Our model achieved an accuracy of $73.77\%$, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and providing valuable insights into how football transfer news is reported.
