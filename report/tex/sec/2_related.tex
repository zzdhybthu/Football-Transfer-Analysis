Identifying misinformation in news reports has been a important topic of data science. In the field of football transfer news, \cite{runsewe2024machine} focused on from the BBC gossip column, extracting 304 days of gossip columns that resulted in 5982 lines of transfer news in the 2021/22 season. We followed the idea of prediction based analysis using machine learning models including Random Forest, but extended it to rumors of various sources, and highlighted the feature engineering process, in which we discussed how different factors of rumors may impact their credibility. 

To extract accurately the attitude of the rumor post to a specific potential transfer, inspired by the work \cite{zhou2023high} on biomedical relations, we called the OpenAI API by prompts integrated with the content of rumor posts to acquire a semi-quantitative score of confidence.
